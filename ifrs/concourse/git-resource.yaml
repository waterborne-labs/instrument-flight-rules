  description: The location of the repository.
- name: branch
  required: false
  example: master
  # describe how this source parameter works, and even provide additional examples.
  description: |
    The branch to track. This is optional if the resource is only used in get steps; however, it is required when used in a put step.
    If unset for get, the repository's default branch is used; usually master but could be different.
- name: private_key
  required: false
  example: |
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

- name: username
  required: false
  example: my-user
  description: |
    Username for HTTP(S) auth when pulling/pushing.
    This is needed when only HTTP/HTTPS protocol for git is available (which does not support private key auth) and auth is required.
- name: password
  required: false
  example: aSOvSF9ql4hf
  description: Password for HTTP(S) auth when pulling/pushing.
- name: paths
  required: false
  # Here's an example where the value type is not a string
  schema:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  # Because the value type is an array, we specify the example as an array too!
  example:
  - "*.txt"
  - README.md
  description: If specified (as a list of glob patterns), only changes to the specified files will yield new versions from check.
- name: ignore_paths
  required: false
  schema:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  example:
  - logs/**/*
  description: |
    The inverse of paths; changes to the specified files are ignored.

    Note that if you want to push commits that change these files via a put,
    the commit will still be "detected", as check and put both introduce versions.

    To avoid this you should define a second resource that you use for commits that change files
    that you don't want to feed back into your pipeline - think of one as read-only (with ignore_paths) and
    one as write-only (which shouldn't need it).
- name: skip_ssl_verification
  required: false
  schema:
    type: boolean
  example: true
  description: Skips git ssl verification by exporting GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true
- name: tag_filter
  required: false
  example: "*foo*"
  description: |
    If specified, the resource will only detect commits that have a tag matching the expression
    that have been made against the `branch`. Patterns are glob(7) compatible (as in, bash compatible).
- name: git_config
  required: false
  schema:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        name: { type: string }
        value: { type: string }
  description: If specified as (list of pairs name and value) it will configure git global options, setting each name with each value.

get:
- name: depth
  required: false
  schema:
    type: integer
  example: 1
  description: If a positive integer is given, shallow clone the repository using the --depth option.
put:
- name: repository
  required: true
  # this parameter needs a path to something, most likely another resource or task output
  path_input: true
  example: source
  description: The path of the repository to push to the source.

outputs:
# this output is special, in that it should describe the contents of the directory created from a `get`
- path: /
  description: The cloned repo
# if you have specific files that always exist inside the root directory, add additional outputs, with the name being the path to that file. You should exclude the leading `/` in the path
- name: .git/committer
  example_contents: foo@bar.com
  description: |
    For committer notification on failed builds. This special file .git/committer which is populated with the email address of the author of the last commit. This can be used together with an email resource like mdomke/concourse-email-resource to notify the committer in an on_failure step.
